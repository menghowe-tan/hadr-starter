# Implementation notes

Kept by the agent, reviewed by you. One entry per working block.

## Decisions

- **2026-07-08 — Slicing via build-agent-skills, adapted inline.** The PRD
  was cut into three vertical slices using the slicing step (F) of
  bguiz/build-agent-skills `build-2-plan-specs` ("vertical implementation
  increments, each ending in demo-able UI"). Adaptations: the shaping
  sub-skills are not installed, so no SHAPING.md/BREADBOARD.md were produced
  — the PRD §3 pipeline is the already-selected shape and
  `docs/product-design.md` stands in for the breadboard; slice detail files
  follow the skill's F1–F3 outputs (`docs/SLICES.md`, `docs/SLICE-V*.md`
  with test plans), but issues were filed directly with `gh` using the
  repo's own slice template (the skill's step I writes issue files instead;
  the user asked for GitHub issues).

## Open questions

## Deviations

<!-- Anything built that departs from the PRD or CLAUDE.md is recorded here,
     with the reason. An undocumented deviation is a bug. -->

- **2026-07-08 — `dashboard.html` is not committed to the repo.** The README
  assumes the agent "publishes a morning situation report to
  `dashboard.html`" in-repo. Per the PRD interview (answers #12–15), the user
  rejected committing regenerated views daily: committed JSON under `data/`
  is the system of record, and the sitrep document + Leaflet map page are
  generated views deployed to an external host (Netlify/Vercel class, deploy
  token in Actions secrets). The self-contained sitrep HTML still serves as
  the course's `dashboard.html` artefact — it just lives at the host, not in
  main. Reason: daily generated-file commits add noise without audit value;
  the data commits already provide the history.
